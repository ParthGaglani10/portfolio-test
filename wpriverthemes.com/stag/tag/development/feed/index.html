Our team meticulously devised a comprehensive brand strategy centered around creating a visually. Our goal was to provide a strong visual language and help BizzBuzz to stand out and get the appealing look &#038; feel which resonates with a target audience and gives a feeling of joy and safety during product usage. Also, we needed to introduce the product to potential users. BizzBuzz is a travel startup born by the collaboration of professionals from tech and banking industries. The company has a strong dev department but the design language was weak and kit-made so that they had a risk of getting lost in the pool of competitors.</p>
